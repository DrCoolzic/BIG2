@par Release 2.2a October 2014

This is the first release of the BIG sources with English documentation.
This release is based on release V2.13 from Claude Attard (dated 11/02/99) 
At this point the source code has not be changed compared to the 
original code other than: 
- translating / adding comments in English 
- using slightly different formating and "beautification" of the code
- adding doxygen information (defines, functions...)
- renaming some function calls, global variables, constants, etc.
.

If you were using BIG 2.0x 2.1x you should be able to recompile your code without
modification with this new release. Old French function names are translated
automatically to new English name in the big2.h file.
For new development it is recommended to use the new English names.
