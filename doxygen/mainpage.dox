<b>Preface by Jean Louis-Guerin</b>

First of all a big thank to <b>Claude ATTARD</b> for the "BIG" work he has
done on the BIG library and for donating the library to the public domain.\n

Most of the documentation presented here, is just the translation in English of the 
original BIG library documentation written by Claude ATTARD. I have tried to stay 
as close as possible to the "spirit" of the original text in French. 
However the documentation has been completely reorganized and several new chapters,
pictures, links, etc. have been added.

The documentation has been generated from annotated code using Doxygen in HTML and compiled HTML (.chm) format.\n
I am not a native English person and therefore the translation is far from being 
in perfect (or even good) English. Please feel free to contact me if you find mistakes.

@section big_toc Table of Contents
	- @ref page_big_pres\n
	This page provides a high level presentation of the functionality of the
	BIG library and the tools required to use it. It also presents the motivations and
	the history of the library as well as acknowledgment to contributors.

	- @ref page_big_development\n
	This page explains how to build applications with BIG library. As the sources 
	are now public domain it also explain how to build the library itself.
	
	- @ref page_big_gui\n
	This page presents the GUI elements of an application developed with BIG. 
	If you write an application using BIG, this document can be used as a skeleton 
	to write the GUI section of your user's manual.
	
	- @ref page_big_demo\n
	This page gives a detailed description of the demo program provided with
	BIG release. The program demonstrates most of the functionalities that can be
	easily achieved with the BIG library.
	
	- @ref page_big_source\n
	This page walk you through the source of the BIGDemo program.
	
	- @ref page_ref_manual\n
	This page gives detailed information on writing program with the BIG library. 
	It is the most important part of the documentation for programmers using BIG.
	Note that programming information can also be accessed from the \b Constant 
	page (@ref const_group), the \b Type definition page (@ref typedef_group), the \b Global 
	variables page (@ref global_group), the \b Functions page (@ref function_group), 
	as well as from the \b big2.h description page.

/*! @defgroup const_group The BIG Constants
@brief The BIG Constants

To facilitate programming, BIG proposes (and uses) many constant definitions.

@brief The BIG Typedefs

BIG defines several specific type used by the program.

/*!	@defgroup global_group The BIG Global Variables
@brief The BIG global variables

BIG works with some global variables, which are accessible from anywhere in the program. 
Their number was limited as much as possible, but for certain functions it avoids the
need to pass a lot of argument pointers not always easy to remember and type.

/*!	@defgroup function_group The BIG Functions Library
@brief The BIG Functions

BIG contains a large number of functions.\n
Only the "external" functions that the programmer must (or can) call will be 
presented here. BIG internal functions are not documented.\n 
Among all the available functions, about thirty of them are used very often.
